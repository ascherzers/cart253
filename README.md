## Description

In Greek Myth Jump, you control a character from Greek mythology, as you try to fulfill their destiny by jumping and collecting memory fragments. These fragments unlock parts of the story, which unfold as you progress. You must navigate platforms, avoid falling into the abyss, and survive the dangers that await. As you gather fragments, the game's background and narrative evolve, creating a dynamic journey that merges mythological adventure with arcade style gameplay.
